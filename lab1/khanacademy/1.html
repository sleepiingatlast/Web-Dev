        Basic info about penguins:
        </h2>
        
        <p>The <em></em> is awesome because they live in some of the coldest, harshest environments, like <em>Antarctica</em>, but they thrive thanks to their <strong>amazing</strong> adaptations. </p>
        <p>Unlike most birds, penguins <em>can't fly</em>, but they're the best swimmers and world-class waddlers. Plus, their <strong>tuxedo-like</strong> feathers keep them looking sharp no matter how chilly it gets!</p>
